1_4PerBox-6_6PerBox : We need 2 boxes as the paper print fill the box completely and then one more for the canvas
2_4PerBox-4_6PerBox : We need 2 large boxes  because the  2 canvas fit half the box and the 4 paper print would fit 2/3 of a large box. they cant fit together.
2_4PerBox-5_6PerBox: We need 2 boxes as the 5 paper print almost fill  the box completely and then 2  more for the canvas.
